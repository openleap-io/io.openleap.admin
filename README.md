# OpenWMS CORE Admin UI
This monitoring application is based on [Spring Boot Admin Server](https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin) and can be used to 
visualize the state of a distributed microservice application and monitor and control single services.

It is part of the CORE domain because it can also be used outside logistics projects and belongs to the technical infrastructure components
of a typical microservice application built with Spring Boot.

In OpenWMS projects it's main purpose in production is to control the log level of single components and categories as well as controlling
caches.
